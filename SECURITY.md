# Security and Vulnerability Disclosure

If you discover a vulnerability or a concerning capability in this repository, please report it to the repository owner via the GitHub private security contact or by opening a private issue and marking it `security`. Do not publish proof-of-concept exploit code publicly.

Responsible disclosure steps:
1. Create a private issue describing the concern and its potential impact.
