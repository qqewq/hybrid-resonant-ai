# Contributing Guidelines (Responsible Research)

Thank you for your interest. This project accepts contributions that improve documentation, safety checklists, reproducible toy demonstrations, and governance templates. We do **not** accept contributions that add deployable or high-risk autonomous capabilities.

Please:
1. Open an issue describing your proposed change.
2. For code/documentation changes, create small focused pull requests.
3. For anything that might increase capability, *first* open an issue and wait for maintainers and safety reviewers to approve.
4. Follow `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

We encourage contributors to include:
- A short safety assessment of the change.
- Tests that are strictly non-deployable and verifiable.
