# 🔬 Hybrid Resonant AI Framework

A cutting-edge AI architecture that fuses the power of Transformer-based language models (like GPT) with goal-driven resonance analysis, RL and GAN-based evolution, and dynamic constraint manipulation.

> Designed to search for "impossible" hypotheses and strategies that can transcend known physical limits — and make them discoverable.

## 🧠 Key Components

- **🎯 Goal-Driven Intelligence** – All processes start from a user-defined goal (`G`).
- **🧠 GPT-style Hypothesis Generator** – Generates contextual hypotheses and strategies.
- **📊 Resonant Evaluator** – Assesses each hypothesis by its influence on the target, using gradient and resonance-based scoring.
- **♻️ RL + GAN Evolution Module** – Evolves promising ideas iteratively based on feedback.
- **⚙️ Dynamic Constraints Engine** – Allows modifying "laws of nature" inside the hypothesis space (e.g. time, light speed, entropy).

## 🧪 Demo Example

```bash
python example.py --goal "Extend human life expectancy to 150 years"
```

Or use the included Jupyter notebook in `examples/`:
- `g150_life_extension.ipynb`

## 🌌 Vision

This framework aims to become a **meta-thinking engine** — not just a predictive AI, but a system capable of *inventing theoretical realities* and finding real-world strategies to reach them.
