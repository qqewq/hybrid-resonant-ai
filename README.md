# Hybrid Resonant AI â€” Repository (Conceptual / Research Archive)

**WARNING / IMPORTANT**  
This repository is a *conceptual and research-focused* archive about theoretical ideas, simulations, and safety practices related to high-capability AI research.  
It **does not** contain instructions, tooling, or step-by-step code that would enable the build or deployment of an autonomous superintelligent system (ASI).  
The content is deliberately high-level and oriented toward safety, ethics, reproducibility, and responsible disclosure.

## Purpose
This repository collects:
- Conceptual descriptions and academic-style notes on the "hybrid resonant" approach (theoretical).
- Safe, small-scale demonstration code for non-deployable simulations (toy models for visualization only).
- Policies and templates for responsible open-source release, contribution, and vulnerability disclosure.
- A roadmap and suggested governance/ethics checkpoints for any advanced AI research.

## GitHub Repository
[ðŸ”— https://github.com/qqewq/hybrid-resonant-ai](https://github.com/qqewq/hybrid-resonant-ai)

## Quick links
- `docs/` â€” design notes, roadmap, ethics guidance.
- `examples/` â€” small, safe demo scripts (non-deployable).
- `src/` â€” placeholders for components (no production code).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` â€” project governance.

## License & Usage
See `LICENSE`. By using or forking this repository you agree to follow the responsible release and research guidelines described in `docs/ETHICS.md` and `SECURITY.md`.

## How to use
This archive is intended as a **research and documentation** starting point only. It is safe to publish, discuss, and build community processes around.  
Do **not** use or adapt any element of this repository to attempt to create or deploy powerful autonomous systems without formal institutional oversight, external audits, and compliance with applicable law.
